You need to make a Pull Request to the originel repository to submit the assignment.

### Follow the following steps to create a Pull Request.

* part 1 pushing the repo to your github
   use the following commands in your terminal/cmd (wherever you think git --version would work)
   * `cd` to your repository beware it's the upper folder Assignment-1-MnC19 and not inside it
   * set upstream repository by doing `git remote add upstream https://github.com/Smit-create/Assignment-1-MnC19.git`
   #### After doing the assignment and having all the output files you will be commiting them.
   * do `git add .`
   * then `git commit -m "any message you feel like giving to the coomit" `
   * then simply do `git push` and provide any creds if required
   
* Part 2 creating a PR from your repo to original repo
    * Head over to your repo on github (not this repo but your fork)
    * There will be a fresh button showing compare and pull request click that
    * Fill in the details and do a PR!!
